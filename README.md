## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. These are some requirements of this challenge:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
